# Strategic-Operational-Analytics-Siemens-Mobility
Siemens Mobility-style operational analytics project combining KPI dashboarding (Tableau), SQL-based revenue leakage audits, and productivity bottleneck analysis for an urban rail expansion simulation.

Key Findings
1️⃣ Schedule Performance

75% of milestones were completed on time.

Remaining delays were concentrated in high-downtime segments.

2️⃣ Operational Bottlenecks

Segment 6 and Segment 2 show the highest downtime ratios (~15%+).

These segments likely contribute to downstream schedule risks.

3️⃣ Revenue Leakage

Vendor 2 accounts for the largest overbilling exposure (~$30K+).

Invoice mismatch rate stands at ~64%, indicating financial control gaps.

Duplicate and rate mismatch patterns suggest need for tighter AP validation.

4️⃣ Efficiency Indicators

Average track installation rate: ~2,165 meters/week.

Downtime ratio overall: ~8%.
